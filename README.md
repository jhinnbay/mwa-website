Inspiration

Digital Libraries are vulnerable to shutdown.

Z Library, Ron DeSantis, etc. Libraries only have limited copies of audiobooks and limited resources. There's no way to actually own books, and Amazon & other companies have taken over with unfair subscription models. There's no way to onboard the next 100,000 users in Web3 with strictly video games, NFTs, and consumer products. We created an individual ERP Platform curated to help onboard mass adoption by 74% by creating value in a with books and rich resources available online, in a decentralized manner

Mental Wealth Academy is the academic knowledge layer of the project and utilizes a focus on connecting resources and a rich ecosystem while building a community of DAO consensus players to participate.

Mental Wealth Academy is a full-scale full-circle ERP educational platform.

What It Does & How We Built It

Utilizes DAO Technology on Polygon Network.
DAO technology keeps resources regulated and decentralized.
Complex Smart Contract is used to store and update the Library's directory.
IPFS is utilized + Pi√±ata to ensure longevity in resources and documents with data permanence.
Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) for NFT book data.
Chainlink functions for on-demand backstory and dungeon generation.
Users connect while providing massive learning opportunities for all.
Marketplace and ecosystem for books and authorship promotes reading & writing comprehension.
Ecosystem values intellectuals and academics, ensuring Crypto + NFTs become digestible for college students.
Challenges & Accomplishments

Timezones were a huge issue to communication... it was actually very frustrating. Once we tackled the optimal timezone issues most collaboration went extremely smooth. Defeating the rough patches, after we set up a few designs and flow charts we were able to communicate with the partners we required to build our individual pieces, it was a rough finish but we did it. I'm proud of my team for completing everything with such limited time and resources.

What's next for Mental Wealth Academy

Continue to build and provide services for communities at scale by onboarding and curating our digital ecosystem to fine tune what resources are exactly needed.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
