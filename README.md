## Inspiration

### Digital Libraries are vulnerable to shutdown.

Z Library, Ron DeSantis, etc. Libraries only have limited copies of audiobooks and limited resources. There's no way to actually own books, and Amazon & other companies have taken over with unfair subscription models. There's no way to onboard the next 100,000 users in Web3 with strictly video games, NFTs, and consumer products. We created an individual ERP Platform curated to help onboard mass adoption by 74% by creating value in a with books and rich resources available online, in a decentralized manner

Mental Wealth Academy is the academic knowledge layer of the project and utilizes a focus on connecting resources and a rich ecosystem while building a community of DAO consensus players to participate.

**Mental Wealth Academy** is a full-scale full-circle ERP educational platform.

## What It Does & How We Built It

- **Utilizes DAO Technology on Polygon Amoy, Cardona, Avalanche Fuji C-chain, Scroll:**
  - DAO technology ensures that resources are regulated and decentralized.
  - Community members vote on resource additions and manage the platform’s evolution.

- **Complex Smart Contracts:**
  - Smart contracts are used to store and update the library's directory.
  - Implements Chainlink VRF for random selection processes and Chainlink Automation for scheduled governance actions.

- **IPFS and Piñata for Data Permanence:**
  - IPFS and Piñata ensure the longevity of resources and documents, providing data permanence.

- **Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP):**
  - Chainlink CCIP is used for NFT book data, enhancing cross-chain communication and asset transfers.

- **Chainlink Functions:**
  - Chainlink Functions are used for on-demand resource verification and off-chain data interactions.

- **Comprehensive Learning Ecosystem:**
  - Users connect, providing massive learning opportunities for all.
  - The marketplace and ecosystem for books and authorship promote reading and writing comprehension.
  - Values intellectuals and academics, ensuring Crypto and NFTs become digestible for college students.
